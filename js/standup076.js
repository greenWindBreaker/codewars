//graphs and trees
//linkedlist made up of nodes, each node has a value and a pointer. value can = anything. each pointer has a 'next' pointer.
//graphs are nodes that are connected to each other
//idea: large node based structure, delviery apps use graph
//this week we will learn about Trees
//they expand in one direction. think of an upside down tree. the fist node is called the 'root node'
//pair and child relationships
//you can have one parent node that branch out to many children node
//heaps keep stuff in order, good for holding words
//binary trees: each node has a max of 2 pointers. left and right pointer. becomes the basis of a lot of common problems in job hunt. 
//file systems depend on tree systems.
//the DOM is a node structure, its a tree like structure <div - parent > <p-child ></p> <p- sibling ></p> </div>
