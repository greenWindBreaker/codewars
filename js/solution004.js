//Instructions:
//reverse a list order
//example: [1,2,3,4] -> [4,3,2,1]

/*function reverseList(list){
    //code here
}
*/
// my solution below:
const reverseList = (list) => list.reverse()
// i used const as my variable but it would still work with lets variable
//arrow function elimate the return word and curly brackets so that the code fits in one line
