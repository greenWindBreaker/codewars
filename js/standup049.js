//standup049
//thursday, 01/19/23, standup @6pm on remo.co
//we talked about the problem below and had Q&A 
//whenever we see a graph like tree shape -> think recursion. ex: fibanoci challenge
//memoized solution of the fibonocci?  
//recurse solution
//memoize solution
//iterative solution
// Factorial
// In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,
// 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
// The factorial of 0! is 1.
// #Your task:
// You have to create the function factorial that receives n and returns n!. You have to use recursion.
//news: not sure if next week there will be standup or not
