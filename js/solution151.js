//Add the value "codewars" to the websites array.
//After your code executes the websites array should == ["codewars"]
//The websites array has already been defined for you using the following code: var websites = []

websites.push('codewars')// this will modify the existing array instead of making a new array. if we wanted to make a new array then we would write-> websites = ['codewars']
